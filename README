hps2x64 - Playstation 2 simulator
Status: In development - Not ready for release

*** HPS1x64 Instructions ***

To run bios dumped from a Playstation system:
Use File | Load | Bios to load a bios dump. Use File | Run to run a bios dump after loading it.

To run Playstation formatted game discs:
Can run bin/img/iso images with cue, ccd, and sub support.
To run a disc image, use File | Load | Bios to load a bios, then use File | Load | Insert/Remove Game Disk to load a game disk image (bin/img/iso/etc), then File | Run to run it.
Make sure that cue/ccd/sub files have the same name as the disk image and are in the same folder, or they will not load.
note: audio is delayed a few seconds by default. You can change the size of the audio buffer via Audio | Buffer Size.

To change disks:
If a disk image is loaded, you will see a check mark next to the File | Load | Insert/Remove Game Disk option.
To remove the disk image, select the option again, and then you will see the check mark disappear. You can now load a new disk via the same option.

To load a save state:
First load the disk image, then load the save state, then use File | Run.

Keys:
Use Peripherals | Configure Joystick... and then follow the instructions to configure a compatible dual analog game pad.
Note: If the keys don't work for a title, then toggle analog/digital mode (Peripherals->Pad 1->Pad 1 Digital/Analog).

Troubleshooting:
If controls are not working properly, then try switching between digital/analog mode (for both pads if needed). Pads are set to analog by default for compatibility.
If a game does not load properly, try deleting/moving the memory card files.

Build instructions:
For hps1x64.exe (PS1 simulator) - install MinGW64 (I use the tools at http://www.drangon.org/mingw/), run Makefile.bat which is in the same folder as this README file (must have "make" installed)
For hps2x64.exe - Not ready for compilation
Note: A version of hps1x64.exe should have been built for you already and should be in the same folder as this README file. For test/evaluate ONLY.
